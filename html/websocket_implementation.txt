* [V] Start websocket when the user enter in seats reservation wizard page (ReservationPage.php).

* [V] Stop websocket when user:
    - [V] finish reservation;
    - [V] close the browser;
    - [V] close the browser tab;
    - [X] cancel the wizard - is this currently supported?

* [V] When a seat is marked as taken:
    - [V] user finish the wizard;

* [X] [Optional] When a seat is marked as temporarily taken:
    - user select a seat;

* [X] [Optional] When a seat is not marked as temporarily taken:
    - user deselect a seat;
    - user close the browser;
    - [X] user cancel the wizard - is this currently supported?

To do:
    - when there is taken seats conflict and neither users have seats wizard page open. Then:
        - which user press first rezerva wins;
        - for 2nd user, before inserting in db the reservation info, check if his seats are already in db as taken
         seats. If so pop a error message and then open wizard again;
    - when there is taken seats conflict and one user register his seats and the other is in seats wizard page. Then:
        - mark the taken seats as such and remove it from user's seats array.

Issues:
    - now seats are marked as taken regardless of hour and cinema room. Fix this as soon as possible.

        };
        var data = {
            locuri: '1_1|1_2',

            username : 'username_' + time
        };
        socket.send(JSON.stringify(data));

        var data = JSON.parse(e.data);

    php

        json_encode(array('locuri' => '1'))

        json_encode(array('locuri' => '1', 'user' => $data->username, 'msg' => $data->msg))

        $data = json_decode($data);
